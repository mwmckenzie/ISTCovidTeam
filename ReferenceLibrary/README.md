# IST-184 COVID Data Reference Library
## About The Reference Library
This Reference Library is intended to store original and unmodified data sets pulled from the source. Data definitions, descriptions, and other various information related to the baseline data sets collected for this project will be stored in the library, as well.

## Current State
A collection of initial data sets from the JHU COVID data Github repo and the ECDC have been updated. Additionally, collected metadata has been uploaded to the Reference Library, but is currently mostly unsorted/unorganized within their parent folders.

## Future Work
Reference materials and data sets will be better organized, with updates to a more standardized format.
