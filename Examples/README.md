# Example Files and Demos

## About

A root folder for storing and sharing application, language, or platform specific workflows, methodologies, and techniques.

## Initial Folder Structure

Folders within the example root folder will initially be subdivided by application, language, or platform as applicable.

## Sub-folder Structure

Within each application, language, or platform folder will be a separate folder for each example or demo. All folders, files, and other dependencies for the example or demo should be included within the example/demo sub-folder.
> If the example/demo will require data or files outside of the folder, consider creating/adding a readme file or help text with clarifying instructions or an API description.
