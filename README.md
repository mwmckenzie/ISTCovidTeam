# IST-184 COVID Data Github Repository
## About The IST-184 COVID Data Github Repository
This Github Repo is intended to be used as a central hub for storing, sharing, and collaborating datasets and other information used by the IST-184 COVID team.

## Current State
This repo is still in the very earliest stages of set-up and population. Literally everything should be considered a work-in-progress.

A number of data sets pulled from a few different sources have been uploaded in the formats in which they were downloaded. Work has begun to clean, partition, and organize the data sets for various applications and use-cases.

Additionally, metadata and other reference information has been pulled with all data sets and is stored within the Reference Library.

## Questions & Requests
Edit this document by clicked in the upper-right. Add your questions to the list in the questions section. Add your requests to the list in the requests section. I'll be investigating creating additional sections for each, or moving these functions to another part of the repo at a later date.
