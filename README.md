# IST-184 COVID Data Github Repository
## About The IST-184 COVID Data Github Repository
This Github Repo is intended to be used as a central hub and collaboration space for the storing, sharing, and exploration of datasets and other information used by the IST-184 COVID team.
## Current State
This repo is still in the very earliest stages of set-up and population. Literally everything should be considered a work-in-progress.
## Structure
### Reference Library Folder
A number of data sets pulled from a few different sources have been uploaded in the formats in which they were downloaded. Additionally, metadata and other reference information has been pulled with all data sets and is stored within the Reference Library.
### Data Folder
Work has begun to clean, partition, and organize the data sets for various applications and use-cases.
### Example Files and Demos Folder
Added a root folder for storing and sharing application, language, or platform specific workflows, methodologies, and techniques. Create a folder within the applicable application/langauge folder and then add your application file and any other required files/folders necessary for the example or demo to successfully execute. 
If the example will require data or files outside of the folder, consider creating or adding a readme file or help text with clarifying instructions or an api description.
## Questions & Requests
A discussion forum has been created expressly to make it easy to ask questions, make suggestions, or post requests for changes to the repo or the datasets. The discussion section can be found in the repo navigation bar. Alternatively, follow this [link](https://github.com/mwmckenzie/ISTCovidTeam/discussions/1)
## A Team Repo
This is intended to be a team repository, so feel free to update and contribute anywhere and everywhere. Changes can always be rolled-back in the event of catastrophe... Probably! ;)
